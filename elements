             <p>Server infrastructure is the backbone of all IT shops. Whether you are 
                 bare-metal or virtual I have tons of experience using the top hypervisors: 
                 VMware, Hyper-V, Nutanix AHV, and KVM and Traditinal servers.  </p>

            <p>The security perimeter of the future is defeinety on the endpoint, 
                not a firewall. Until then, I've used Palo Alto, Meraki, and 
                Sonicwalls over the last few years. </p>

		<h3>Cloud Engineering</h3>
		<p>This is my favorite part of IT. It combines a deep understanding of how systems work together, 
        and what systems make up other systems. The more i work in this realm the more i realize that
        IT is really about managing tightly couple, complex systems. I could list lots of technologies
        here, but they change so often. Thats the point, my greatest skill are arent some new technology 
        or language. My greatest strengths are my resiliency, adaptabilty, and being very good at learning quickly.
